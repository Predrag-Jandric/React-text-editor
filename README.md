## About 👋

This exercise is testing the features of pre-made rich text editor from Froala and all of the features for changing text such as making letters bold, italic, making tables and many more.

What I did here: 
- Implemented this pre-made rich text editor
- Implemented dark / light mode
- Implemented local storage

This is my version of a very similar project (https://youtu.be/O-xgS9G7A6A?si=7DsHtKsrgOY0Xmx5).
